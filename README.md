# deep-learning-challenge

In this analysis a neural networks model is developed for nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup,  using the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
A CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years is used for creating the model.

## Python Libraries Used:
